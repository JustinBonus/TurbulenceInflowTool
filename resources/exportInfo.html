<h1>What to do?</h1>
<p>Once you selected your inflow model and adjusted parameters accordingly, you are ready to export a modified set of openFOAM input files.</p>
<p>You may choose to just modify the boundary file, or to create a duplicate file tree to preserve the original files.>
<ul>
<li>If "duplicate  entire file tree on export" is checked, the original folder will copied into a folder named "original" and the modified version will be at the place of the provided input.</li>
<li>Otherwise, exporting  will save the original boundary definition file with an _orig extension and replace it by one representing the selected boundary condition. If such a file already exists, it will be overwritten without warning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once exported, you input definition is ready to be analyzed using openFOAM.</p>
